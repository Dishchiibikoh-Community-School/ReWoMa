## 🌐 Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project auto-deploys to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions on every push to `master`.

1. Make sure the repo name matches the `homepage` in `package.json`.
	- Current value: `/ReWoMa`
	- If your repo name is different, update that value.
2. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
	- **Source**: `GitHub Actions`
3. Push to `master` (or run the workflow manually from Actions tab).

Optional manual fallback:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

After saving, wait ~1–3 minutes and open:

`https://<your-username>.github.io/ReWoMa/`

## 👩‍🏫 Teacher Portal

Click **Teacher** on the home screen. Default password: `mathteacher2024`

From the portal you can:
- **Add custom questions** to any difficulty level
- **Delete questions** you don't want
- **Reset** the question bank to defaults

Custom questions are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist between sessions on the same machine.

- Each student plays on their own device/browser — scores are stored locally per browser
- The auto-generated names prevent inappropriate names on the leaderboard
- Teachers can add curriculum-aligned questions via the Teacher Portal
- The "Why This Matters" section after each answer helps students connect math to real life
